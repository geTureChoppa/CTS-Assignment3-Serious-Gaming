        <p>Implementing simulations and gaming for education, there are already several choices available to cater to the specific goals of a learner. Simulations have the capability of recreating interactive scenarios. These can be scientific experiments, historical events (Civilizations, Total War) and ecological systems (SimCity). These games, and simulations in general, provide the opportunity to explore and experiment within these scenarios which allows for experiential learning. Virtual Reality games also open up an entirely new level of digital simulations. Further increasing the realism of simulations, directly placing a user within a 3-dimensional environment. These simulations make for highly immersive and interactive scenarios as they replicate a real or imaginary setting that may happen in real life or are either difficult or impossible, to happen. (Fran Strachan, 2016). Although the purpose of games is usually for entertainment, serious gaming is focused on educational and training purposes. Often these games simulate real scenarios and professional environments that can train specific skills or knowledge. </p>

        <p>However, the umbrella of computers in education covers not only digital simulations and serious gaming. Several opportunities for learning are opened through the use of technology and are not limited to only games. Presentation technology in harmony with digital simulations and serious gaming has been proven to enhance classroom spaces. Traditional spaces were equipped with whiteboards and several resources on paper. As a result of this, learning new content often came at a slower pace. However, with the replacement of advanced technology, the education sector was equipped with the choice of upgrading. These upgrades would further benefit not only the students but tutors as well. Being able to quickly access resources and allowing individuals to learn at their own desired pace. As every student is learning at their own individual pace, it is important that they absorb the content properly. Hence why online tools must compose of unique but consistent methods to transfer given material. Ultimately, bringing the student not only knowledge but comfort and comprehension. (Baeker, R. M. 2019). </p>

        <p>Artificial Intelligence has also been proven to be of use within digital classrooms. As intelligence tutoring has been shown to provide students with extra help in learning. Although not fully capable of replacing teachers and tutors, several artificial intelligence models were able to supply students with existing content needed to improve. The content consists of hints and online video solutions. Artificial intelligence, however, is not only entirely beneficial to the student but to teachers as well. Artificial intelligence could be used to produce individual student reports, returning them to the teacher. From this the teacher would be able to grasp each student's learning pace in a more efficient way. From this, teachers are able to develop appropriate learning curricula actively helping students to improve their skills. (Baeker, R. M. 2019).  </p>

        <p>Online learning environments could prompt institutions to fully transition into virtual learning. In the concept of online learning, it allows for both students and educators to have more flexible schedules. However, this comes at the serious risk of personal time control and management in being able to cope with given content remotely. Despite this, the possibility remains a choice. (Baeker, R. M. 2019). </p>
