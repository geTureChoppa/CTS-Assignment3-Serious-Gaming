    <div class="col-sm my-4 text-center">
        <p>We have chosen this topic as it sparks our interests, particularly the advancements made in digital simulations and gaming. As previously mentioned, extra material in different formats was made accessible to students due to online learning. These materials could come in the form of different useful sources such as RStudio, photoshop etc Relating this to the serious gaming aspect, platforms such as Minecraft, the sims and other entertaining resources have also been deemed as useful in education. It piques our interest as we are firm believers that making education fun is also a convenient way to help students in getting motivation to learn.</p>
        <p>Using digital simulations and gaming in education can lead to a few opportunities for society, which some have been mentioned above – increasing engagements and motivations, developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills, in-depth researching. But uniquely it also can provide technological literacy, and online education. Technological literacy allows the student to become familiar with technology and digital literacy through the different software applications, user interfaces and virtual environments. This allows them to keep up with the technological advancements that are rapidly evolving in the modern world. Technology has allowed us to implement educational opportunities to online platforms which connects the gap for education around the world. Students can trial experiential situations with another student from a different region which allows a wider view in perspectives.

        We have also selected this topic as it Is extremely relevant to our chosen target demographic; University students.</p>

        <p>We have chosen our target demographic to be university students, more so students who aren't firm believers that technology isn't a useful tool to use within their studies. The reason being the assignments aim which states "state a topics impact on society in general and also upon the individual". This influences our final project to be something that is able to provide useful information as well are persuade them to agree with our statements and beliefs.</p>

        <p>Organization Level Analysis: At the organization level, the focus would be on how educational institutions, such as schools or universities, incorporate and implement digital simulation and gaming in their educational practices. This involves examining the organizational strategies, policies, and practices related to the use of these technologies, as well as the organizational culture and structure that support their integration. Factors such as leadership, resources, training, and decision-making processes within educational organizations would be considered at this level.</p>

        <p>Responsibility - individual or professional; Both individual and professional relationships are important in understanding the impact and implications of digital simulation and gaming in education. The individual relationship focuses on the learner's experience and the benefits they derive from engaging with these tools, while the professional relationship examines how educational professionals facilitate and support the use of simulations and gaming for educational purposes.</p>

        <p>Ethical issue - power or equity; Power: Digital simulations and gaming can introduce power dynamics within the educational context. Power imbalances can emerge between students, educators, and educational institutions, as well as between developers or providers of educational simulations and games and the end-users. Ethical concerns may arise when power is unequally distributed, leading to issues such as exploitation, manipulation, or the imposition of certain ideologies or values through the use of simulations and gaming.</p>

        <p>Technology - medical, nuclear, mobile; Accuracy and Realism: In medical and nuclear simulations, accuracy and realism are crucial for effective learning. It is important to ensure that the simulations and games provide accurate representations of medical procedures, nuclear processes, or mobile technology concepts. Misrepresentations or inaccuracies can lead to false understandings and potentially harm students' knowledge and skills development. </p>

        <p>Inclusivity and Diversity: Educational simulations and games should strive for inclusivity and diversity. This means representing a wide range of cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives to create an inclusive learning environment. Avoiding stereotypes, biases, or discriminatory content is essential to ensure fair representation and equal opportunities for all learners. </p>

        <p>Safety and Risk Mitigation: Simulations and games involving medical procedures or nuclear scenarios should prioritize safety. Students should be guided to understand the limitations and potential risks of the simulated activities. Ensuring that the simulations provide a safe environment for learning and that appropriate safety protocols are followed is vital.</p>
