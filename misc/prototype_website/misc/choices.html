<h1>Choices in implementing Simulations and Gaming for Education</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Implementing simulations and gaming for education, there are already several options available for specific goals for the learner. </h4>
  - Simulations recreate scenarios with interaction such as scientific experiments, historical events (Civilizations, Total War) and ecological systems (SimCity). 
  These games, and simulations in general, provide the opportunity to explore and experiment within these scenarios which allows for experiential learning. 
  <br><br>
  - Virtual Reality games make good simulations for highly immersive and interactive scenarios as they replicate a real or imaginary setting that may happen in real life or are either difficult, or impossible, to happen.  
  <Br><br>
  - Although games are usually for entertainment, serious gaming is focused on educational and training purposes. Often these games simulate real scenarios and professional environments that can train specific skills or knowledge.  <p>
