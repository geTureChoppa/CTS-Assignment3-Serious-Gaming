<h1>Risks in implementing Simulations and Gaming for Education</h1>


</ul><h4><p>While these games and simulations seem highly beneficial and harmless, there are risks or potential side effects is that it could become an addiction which could lead to poor academic performance</h4> 

  - Students could use it as a distraction or find it as an addiction, using it as entertainment than engaging in learning purposes. This would then result in a lack of critical thinking. 
  <Br><br>
  - Could be a limit on how much you could transfer the skills learnt in simulations to real life. The immersive and interactive experiences can be easier to handle in simulated environments than real life situations. However, it is crucial that a simulation should be able to transfer experience to real life. 
  <br><Br>
  - Importantly, is the potential to misrepresent environments and scenarios. This could be due to inaccuracies and biases. Misconceptions and discriminatory attitudes. Something similar is also misrepresentation of scenarios that are idealized or simplified than it is in real life.  
  <Br><Br>
  Itâ€™s important that we have clear guidelines and consideration for appropriate content implemented for these developers to look into these simulations and gaming in education for a healthy and responsible usage environment. <p>
