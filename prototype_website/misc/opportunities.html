<h1>Opportunities for Society in Education presented</h1>
<h2>Digital Simulations and Serious Gaming</h2>


</ul><p>Using digital simulations and gaming in education can lead to a few opportunities for society, which some have been mentioned above â€“ increasing engagements and motivations, developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills, in-depth researching. <br><Br>But uniquely it also can provide technological literacy, and online education. Technological literacy allows the student to become familiar with technology and digital literacy through the different software applications, user interfaces and virtual environments. <br><br>This allows them to keep up with the technological advancements that are rapidly evolving in the modern world. Technology has allowed us to implement educational opportunities to online platforms which connects the gap for education around the world. Students can trial experiential situations with another student from a different region which allows a wider view in perspectives. <p>
