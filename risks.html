        <p>While these games and simulations seem highly beneficial and harmless, they carry several risks alongside them.  One of these includes the potential factor of addiction, that can further lead to poor academic performance. Students could use it as a distraction or find it an addiction, using it as entertainment rather than engaging in learning purposes. This would then result in a lack of critical thinking. Although video games and simulations spark an individual's creativity, they also have the capability of reducing their concentration. Dependent on the structure of the educational game, it has the potential of removing the educational values an individual is intended to be learning. In order to properly understand difficult concepts, a student is required to have an intentional amount of focus on a task. This concentration is crucial as it is the core fuel of mental operations required in properly acquiring knowledge. With the concentration being divided, there is no guarantee that the concepts are being properly delivered. (Ya-Ting Carolyn Yang & Chang, 2013). If there is no sense of attentiveness through digital learning, the skills learned are immediately hindered. Therefore, making it harder to translate these newly profound skills into reality. </p>

        <p>Due to an individual's conceptions of learning being disrupted, this could lead to further traits that may last a prolonged period of time. A study conducted within Iran identifies that exposure to computers and online games has peaked several concerns. These applications have replaced a child’s social activity. If this behavior continues, it leads to several health conditions directly related to poor fitness. (Zahra Khiyali et al., 2022). It is important that educational resources have clear guidelines and consideration for appropriate content implemented for these developers to investigate these simulations and gaming in education for a healthy and responsible usage environment. </p>

        <p>Another fault within digital simulations is the commonality of misinterpreting realistic situations. The immersive and interactive experiences could be easier to handle in simulated environments than in real-life situations. However, it is crucial that a simulation should be able to transfer experience to real life.  Simulations have the potential to misrepresent environments and scenarios. This could be due to the fact that potential bias may exist within the development of the simulation. As a result of this several misconceptions and inaccuracies will occur. (Baeker, R. M. 2019). This could lead individuals to misinterpret scenarios that are simplified in comparison to reality. </p>

        <p>Despite some proven faults, digital simulations and gaming can be catered for better use. However, the biggest hindrance within them is the cost of production.  Applications in general cost an extensive amount of money, ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 dollars. (Gupta, D. 2023). These costs are directly translated into the app's development. This phase includes the complexity of the application, its design, its cross-platform availability, updates and testing procedures. Several roles have to be hired in order to fulfil just the planning stages of the educational application. (Dörner et al, 2018). As previously mentioned, the planning stages must take into consideration these four main factors: design, availability and complexity. The initial plan must take into account how complicated the application will be. To finalize this, producers have to consider the business logistics, covering monetization, functionalities and integrations. With the overall design of the application, creators must map out the aesthetics they want for the app. The designated audience for an education app plays a part in how efficient its interface would be to understand. Finally, producers must make arrangements for which platforms the application will be available on. The more platforms it is accessible to, the higher the cost. (Gupta, D. 2023). Post-production costs also contribute. Maintenance costs can range between $4,000 to $8,000 dollars annually to ensure it is running as intended. From the consumer perspective, certain educational platforms too may have their own initial price upon purchasing – not being free. This tends to draw individuals away from using them. It was reported that 29% of parents with a higher income were more likely to purchase educational resources for their children, in comparison to 14% of low-income parents. (Meyer et al., 2021). As a result of this, they would resort to using free applications. However, these free applications have also been stated to be produced of a lower quality than their paid counterparts. </p>
