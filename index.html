<h2>Digital Simulations and Serious Gaming</h2>


</ul><p>Throughout the progression of history, several advancements have been made in education and 
  learning to further develop generational knowledge. Specifically, within the sector of ”Digital
  Simulations and Serious Gaming”.</p> ​

  <p>Initially, the sole purpose of computers was to aid the science, technology, engineering and 
  mathematical industries. Its design revolved around solving complex calculations, which was 
  further developed in order to serve other benefits.</p>
  
  <p>Due to the developments made, the computer was able to be of use within the faction of education 
  as well. Ronald M Baeker in his book titled “Computers and Society: Modern Perspectives” states 
  "that the use of computers heavily helped in conveying further knowledge to students. It helped 
  to provide online tutorials, practice exercises and extra material in different formats for a 
  student to access at their own discretion."​</p>
